# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This website provides a landing page for a digital marketing agency. The problems I solved from this exercise were adding sematic html and css elements and fixing links to different areas of the webpage. I learned about correct html and css syntax and best practices as well as trouble shooting with both html and css, as well as github.
